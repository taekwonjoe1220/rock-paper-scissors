# rock-paper-scissors

First project from scratch :)

Tasks:

computerPlay function - randomly select from 'Rock', 'Paper' and 'Scissors' then return selection

playerSelection - use prompt() to assign value to this variable - use logic to force player into selection that makes sense \* upper vs. lower case? force to lower case for all entries?

playRound function - takes two parameters: playerSelection, computerSelection - returns winner results - followed by string announcing results
